Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")
======================================================

Thank you for your interest in |project|!

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with
Contributions from any person or entity, |author|, the author of |project|, must
have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by
each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license
is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of |project| and
its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any
other purpose.

If you have not already done so, please add a row to the signature table at the
end, then commit and digitally sign the changes with Git and with your GPG key
to indicate your agreement to the CLA.

Please read this document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your
records.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and
future Contributions submitted to |project|. In return, |project| shall not use Your
Contributions in a way that is contrary to the public benefit or inconsistent
with bylaws in effect at the time of the Contribution. Except for the license
granted herein to |author| and recipients of software distributed by |author|,
You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

--------------
1. Definitions
--------------

"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by
the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with |author|. For legal
entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control,
are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered
to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control"
means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management
of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty
percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership
of such entity.

"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any
modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted
by You to |project| for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products
owned or managed by |author| (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition,
"submitted to |project|" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
communication sent to |author| or other members of |project| team, including but
not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control
systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
|project| for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing
by You as "Not a Contribution."

-----------------------------
2. Grant of Copyright License
-----------------------------

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to
|author| and to recipients of software distributed by |author| a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative
works.

--------------------------
3. Grant of Patent License
--------------------------

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to
|author| and to recipients of software distributed by |author| a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as
stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only
to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work
to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent
litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to
which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this
Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that
includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to
make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived
such rights for your Contributions to |project|, or that your employer has
executed a separate Corporate CLA with |author|.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

(see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your
Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or
other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and
trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any
part of Your Contributions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions
-----------------------------------------------------------------

except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for
free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to
in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including,
without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You may submit it to |project| separately from any Contribution, identifying
the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction
(including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license
agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the
work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

-------------------------------
8. You agree to notify |author|
-------------------------------

of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these
representations inaccurate in any respect.

---------------
9. Jurisdiction
---------------

Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties, any litigation
resulting from the interpretation of this CLA, arising between CLA parties or
between other parties, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of
Justice of the European Union, as laid down in article 272 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union.

------------------
10. Applicable Law
------------------

Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties, this CLA shall be
governed by the law of the European Union Member State where |author| has his
seat, resides or has his registered office. This CLA shall be governed by
Belgian law if |author| has no seat, residence or registered office inside
a European Union Member State.
