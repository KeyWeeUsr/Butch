==================================
Butch - The free Batch interpreter
==================================

.. |butch| replace:: Butch Coolidge
.. _butch: https://pulpfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Butch_Coolidge

Named after the famous Pulp Fiction boxer |butch|_ from Tennessee.

**********
How to run
**********

Installation
============

.. code::

   pip install butch

Post-Installation
-----------------

.. |sitepkgs| replace:: ``site.getsitepackages()``
.. _sitepkgs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#site.getsitepackages

Make sure to run the test suite after the installation to verify everything
works as it should. The test suite is included in the package itself, so it
should be located in the first ``site-packages`` folder found via |sitepkgs|_.

.. code::

   python $(python -c "import site;print(site.getsitepackages()[0])")/butch/test.py

Development
-----------

Get the latest version:

.. code::

   pip install https://github.com/KeyWeeUsr/butch/zipball/master

Running
=======

Butch is available as a standalone executable as well as a Python module,
therefore it can be invoked by any of these commands if installed properly::

   butch
   python -m butch

which will launch the REPL (console) directly.

Use ``butch /C "echo Hello, Batch"`` for interpreting a Batch command from a
string or use ``butch /C hello.bat`` to run Batch from a file.

Use ``/K`` switch instead of ``/C`` to jump into the console after a command or
a file finishes.

Use ``butch /h`` to display help for other switches.
